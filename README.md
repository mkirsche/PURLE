# PURLE

Here we introduce PURLE, software for Probabilistic Uncontained Read Length Estimation.

## Compilation: 

javac LengthDistribution.java

## Usage: 

java LengthDistribution Inputfile Outputfile Genomelength  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputfile should contain the length of one sequence (in bp) per line  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternately, the input file can be in FASTQ or FASTA format.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputfile is the file to output sample noncontained read lengths to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genomelength is an integer representing the length (in bp) of the genome
